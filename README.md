Chapter 4: Creating a Starter Project Template

This chapter details creating a well-structured starter project template.  My contribution focused on enhancing project organization and maintainability.  
The four-step process I implemented involved: 
1) Defining File Types:  Categorizing project files (e.g., images, scripts, stylesheets) for efficient management.
2) Folder Creation:  Structuring the project directory with folders corresponding to each file type, improving searchability and reducing clutter.
3) Widget Separation:  Organizing UI widgets into separate files, promoting modularity and reusability.
4) Structure Implementation:  Implementing a clear and consistent file structure, enhancing code readability and simplifying future development and collaboration.

 This structured approach significantly improved the project's overall organization, leading to a more efficient and maintainable codebase.
